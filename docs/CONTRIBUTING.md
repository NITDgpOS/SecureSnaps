# Contributing to SecureSnaps

Many thanks for considering contributing to SecureSnaps.

## When to open an issue?
If you have a question regarding SecureSnaps, first discuss it in the SecureSnaps gitter channel. Opening issues for asking questions regarding the codebase isn't what an issue is for.

Create an issue:
* If you detect a bug in the code
* Want some new feature to be added

## When to send a Pull Request?
Send a Pull Request if and only if, it addresses an Open Issue. If not, discuss it in the channel and then create the corresponding issue on approval and then send in a PR.
All Pull Requests must consist of only one commit and each commit should address only one issue.

## Which Issue to Fix?
Please go through all the open issues and choose the one which is unassigned (check for the assigned label). In case an issue is marked difficult, it may be assigned to more than one developer.

## Where to ask questions regarding a particular Issue?
If your queries are issue specific, it is highly recommended that you comment on that issue to start a discussion instead of posting it in the channel.

## What should I know to be able to contribute?
* How to use Git and Github
* Basic knowledge of Python
That's all. The rest can be learnt on the fly and implemented.

Thank you once again and happy coding! :)
